# Schedule Wizard Quick Start

Schedule Wizard is designed to help you with scheduling a section. Whether you're scheduling full-term, 8-weeks, or something in between, you can see exactly what will be needed. Sort of. Holidays and other potential hangups make this an estimate, but a pretty good one!

Select your units, pick the days, and schedule! That's basically it. Turn on the Advanced Day Selection if you need more flexibility, and/or click the lock to have separate start times for the lecture and lab.

If you'd like to export your data, click the **Copy Summary** button to copy the schedule data to your clipboard. It'll be in a format that's good for email, but terrible for a spreadsheet. The option to copy the data in a format for spreadsheets will come later (probably?), but one step at a time!

For those wanting the nitty gritty, the **Show Details** button provides all the data: contact hours expected, contact hours scheduled, break time, etc.

More stuff coming in the future!
