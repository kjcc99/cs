# Schedule Wizard Quick Start

Schedule Wizard is designed to help you with scheduling a section. This marvelous wonder of modern computing knows your academic calendar, how to handle attendance accounting (hypothetically, anyway), and produces an estimated schedule that's probably better than an estimate, but for legal reasons is still an estimate. It's always possible there are other considerations or rules the Schedule Wizard doesn't know, and thus, estimate. Always an estimate. Legally an estimate. Not a guarantee. Guaranteed to be an estimate.

-----------------------------

Using the wizard is simple: select your term, choose your session length, pick a start time, select your units, pick the days, and hit the giant "Schedule Course" button! Turn on the Advanced Days selection if you need more flexibility, and/or click the lock to have separate start times for the lecture and lab.

If you'd like to export your data, click the **Copy** button (next to **Show Details**) to copy the schedule data to your clipboard. It'll be in a format that's good for email, but terrible for a spreadsheet. Want to copy even more data? Click the dropdown arrow and get the full summary data (see below). More copy options to come soon. Maybe.

For those wanting the nitty gritty, the **Show Details** button provides all the data: contact hours expected, contact hours scheduled, break time, etc.

With any luck, this app has more than a bare minimum of accessibility for screen readers and other software, but there's probably room for improvement. Probably lots, so let the developer know what would be helpful!

More stuff coming in the future!
